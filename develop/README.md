## Code style files

### IntelliJ

Copy the file intellij-java-google-style.xml into your IntelliJ settings directory.  Typically this is ~/.IdeaIC14/.
Place it into the config/codestyles/ directory.  So, for example:

```cp intellij-java-google-style.xml ~/.IdeaIC14/config/codestyles/```

Start IntelliJ, then choose File / Settings / Code Style and choose the Scheme "GoogleStyle"
